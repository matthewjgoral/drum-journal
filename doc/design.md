# INSPIRATION

## Cyclical framework
Music is breathing. Inhale, prepare, hold, focus, observe -> Exhale, release, let go, play.
The whole thing is a cycle between personal, solo practice and communal, shared performance
Each session structure repeats this cycle by beginning with formal, correct, technique exercises and moving into free, improv performances, possibly a couple of times
Each exercise also follows this approach by practicing correctly without context, then putting the exercise into a groove context, maybe into a drumless track, or a recorded song.
